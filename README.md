# Are_We_There_Yet
Project 2 Team Build Are We There Yet?

This is a CWRU coding bootcamp Project 2 Team Assignment.  This project is to show that the students are able to work in a team setting, come up with an original idea and
collaborate together to develop a project.  This project demonstrates the students ability to become comfortable working in a group setting and learning the functionality of GitHub. This project uses the project board function using Kanban and the agile software development method of GitHub which allows for the students to create and delegate tasks.  The group members needed to communicate effectively and work together to build a functioning application.

## User Story

This app was designed for a group of friends that are planning a road trip together and want to organize where they are going, what they want to do on the trip.  Normally as a group of friends a trip is organized via group text message.  This application allows a user to store the information of each trip and and keep the trip organized.
